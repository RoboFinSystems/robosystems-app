# Curated release notes

`tag-release.yml` generates the GitHub release body from a Claude-written
changelog of the changes since the last tag. That framing suits routine
releases but reads poorly for a milestone, where the story is what the version
_is_ rather than what changed since last Tuesday.

To override it, commit the notes here as `v<version>.md` **before** dispatching
`create-release.yml`. The file has to exist at the tagged ref, so it belongs in
release prep alongside the version bump — not added afterwards. When the file is
present the workflow uses it verbatim and skips the generated changelog, the
release-statistics section, and the generated-with footer.

No file, no change: the release falls back to the generated changelog. Skipping
a release is a normal outcome, not a failure.

## Writing a new one

Write the body only. The workflow supplies the `# RoboSystems App v<version>`
heading and the links section, so don't repeat them here — start at the first
line of prose.

The filename is version-specific on purpose: a leftover file can never be picked
up by a later release.

## Archived notes

The minor releases `v1.0.0` through `v1.2.0` predate this mechanism. Their
files are the release bodies as published on GitHub, copied here verbatim so
the writing lives in the repo rather than only in GitHub's database (backfilled
2026-08-04). They keep their original headings and trailing links, so treat
them as records rather than as templates for the format above. None of them
can affect a release — their tags already exist, so the workflow
short-circuits before reading them.

Read the generated ones for what they are: the workflow diffs from the
immediately preceding tag, so a generated minor body describes only the final
slice that carried the bump (`v1.2.0` covers `v1.1.61...v1.2.0`), **not** the
line it closes — the patch releases of the prior line are summarized in no
minor's notes. Each file's trailing Full Changelog link states its true span
(`v1.0.0` is the exception: it spans from `initial`, so it covers everything).
When a future minor deserves a line retrospective, write a curated file —
that's the mechanism above.
