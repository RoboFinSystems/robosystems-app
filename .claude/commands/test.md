Run this command: npm run test:all

Monitor the progress of the tests - don't run it in the background - and systematically fix all test failures, linting & formatting issues, and typecheck problems to achieve 100% completion.

Once "npm run test:all" has run to completion successfully with no error, stop immediately. This takes a while to run.

Your goal is to do this as efficiently as possible while being focused on being able to run "npm run test:all" to 100% completion with NO issues of any kind.
