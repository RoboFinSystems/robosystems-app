description: Review the staged diff against this app's frontend, API-route, and deploy conventions.
---

Review all staged changes (`git diff --cached`) with focus on the contexts below. Read the diff first — if nothing is staged, say so rather than reviewing the working tree.

This is a Next.js 16 App Router frontend (React 19, Tailwind v4, Flowbite) that is a client of the RoboSystems API. It is a **public repository**, so anything staged here becomes world-readable on push.

## Before anything else: is this the right repo?

Shared UI comes from the `@robosystems/core` npm package. A staged edit that patches around a core component's behavior — rather than composing it — will be overwritten by the next version bump. Flag it and point the fix at the `robosystems-core` repo. The same goes for logic that belongs in the RoboSystems API.

`src/lib/` and `src/app/api/` are **per-app copies** shared by name with roboledger-app and roboinvestor-app, not by package. A fix to `rate-limiter.ts`, `client-ip.ts`, `turnstile-server.ts`, or `sns.ts` here probably needs hand-porting to the sibling apps — note it in the review.

## Application context (`src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/lib/`)

**Code quality:**

- Does the code follow existing patterns in the codebase?
- Are components properly typed — no `any` smuggled in to silence `tsc`?
- Is error handling appropriate, and does a failed API call surface something to the user rather than failing silently?

**React & Next.js 16:**

- Are hooks used correctly (dependency arrays, cleanup, no conditional calls)?
- Is `'use client'` applied at the right level — pushed to the leaf that needs it, not hoisted to a layout?
- Does anything server-only (an SDK secret, `process.env` without `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) leak into a client component?
- Route groups carry different assumptions: `(app)` is authenticated, `(landing)` and `(blog)` are public. A page added to the wrong group is an auth bug, not a filing mistake.
- Is state at the right level — local vs. the core contexts (graph, organization, entity, sidebar)?

**UI consistency:**

- Flowbite React components used consistently with the rest of the app?
- Tailwind classes follow existing idiom (and the brand tokens, not hardcoded hex)?
- Dark mode handled on every new surface — this regresses silently and no test catches it.
- Responsive behavior checked, not assumed.

**Accessibility:**

- Labels on inputs, keyboard reachability, sane heading order. `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` catches the mechanical cases, so the findings worth writing down are the ones it can't see.

**Security:**

- XSS: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, unescaped user input, markdown rendered without sanitization.
- Is a new `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable actually public-safe? Those are baked into the client bundle at build time and are public permanently.
- Is authentication enforced for new protected surfaces, or only visually hidden?
- Is sensitive data (tokens, full API payloads) logged or exposed to the client unnecessarily?

## API routes (`src/app/api/`)

Four routes exist: `contact`, `support`, `session/sidebar`, `utilities/health`. For changes here:

- The public form endpoints (`contact`, `support`) are protected by rate limiting (`src/lib/rate-limiter.ts`), Turnstile verification (`src/lib/turnstile-server.ts`), and client-IP derivation (`src/lib/client-ip.ts`). A new public endpoint that skips them is a gap.
- Changes to client-IP derivation deserve close reading: rate limiting keys on it, and the trust model is CloudFront's `CloudFront-Viewer-Address` header first, with `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` as the fallback for requests that didn't arrive through CloudFront. Widening that trust is a spoofing vector.
- Is input validated before it reaches SNS or the RoboSystems client?
- Are errors returned with appropriate status codes, and without echoing internals?

## Proxy / security headers (`src/proxy.ts`)

This is the Next 16 middleware file (renamed from `middleware.ts`) and here it does **security headers and CSP**, not auth. So:

- A CSP directive added to allow a new script/style/image source is a real security decision — is the source necessary, and is it the narrowest host that works?
- Watch the dev-vs-prod branches: `'unsafe-eval'` is dev-only by design. Anything that moves a relaxation into the production branch is a blocking finding.
- Check the `matcher` if paths were added — it excludes `api`, `_next/*`, and static assets on purpose.

## Testing (`src/**/__tests__/`)

- Do new components have corresponding tests?
- Are React Testing Library patterns used correctly (query by role/label, not implementation details)?
- Does a new `@robosystems/*` import need mock coverage in `src/__mocks__/`? Missing stubs fail as opaque module-resolution errors, not assertion failures.
- Is coverage maintained on critical paths (auth, billing, graph selection)?

## Deployment (`.github/workflows/`, `cloudformation/`)

- A new environment variable has to be threaded end to end: `.env.example` → `build.yml` inputs → the deploy workflow's `vars.*` → `cloudformation/template.yaml`. A gap anywhere means it's simply undefined in production.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are baked at **build** time, so changing one requires a redeploy, not a restart.
- Do CloudFormation edits require a stack update, and which stack (`RoboSystemsApp{Staging,Prod}` vs `RoboSystemsAppS3{Staging,Prod}`)?
- Are secrets referenced rather than inlined? Nothing resembling a credential should appear in the diff at all.

## Public-repo hygiene

- No customer names, graph IDs, account data, or internal cost/pricing detail in code comments or fixtures.
- If the change fixes a security issue, keep commit messages and comments terse and non-actionable — the area hardened, never the mechanism. Deploys here are manual, so a pushed fix can describe a still-live bug.

## Output

Provide a summary with:

1. **Issues**: Problems that should be fixed before commit
2. **Suggestions**: Improvements that aren't blocking
3. **Questions**: Anything unclear that needs clarification

Anchor each finding to `file:line`. If the staged diff is clean, say so plainly rather than manufacturing findings.
