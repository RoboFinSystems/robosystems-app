# Multi-arch note: the Docker Hub image is built for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
# on one x86 runner. Every stage that runs Node is pinned to the build platform
# (--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM) so nothing executes under QEMU emulation: an
# emulated `npm ci` crashed intermittently with SIGILL and then hung the build
# for the full retry window. Only the runtime stage is the target platform, and
# it never runs Node at build time.

# Pinned: the node image bundles npm 11.17.0 but `npm@latest` silently crossed into
# npm 12 on 2026-07-08, so image builds have been changing major versions unattended.

# --- Runtime Dependencies Stage ---
# Production node_modules for the TARGET platform, resolved on the build
# platform: npm's cpu/os/libc flags select the target's optional native packages
# (@next/swc-*, @img/sharp-*, ...) without executing any of them. Nothing in
# this lockfile has an install script that runs on Linux (only fsevents, which is
# macOS-only), so the cross-install is exact.
# This is the authoritative runtime node_modules — we deliberately do NOT copy
# node_modules from the builder, so devDependencies (jsdom, vitest, eslint, ...)
# stay out of the scanned runtime image and don't drag in their CVEs.
# Nested lockfiles shipped inside package tarballs (demo/playground dirs) are
# never read at runtime, but container scanners parse them as installed
# dependencies and flag phantom CVEs.
